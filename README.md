# Procedural-Terrain-Generation
This is a Unity project largely following Sebastian Lague's tutorial found on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&amp;list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3&amp;ab_channel=SebastianLague

This project has been extremely helpful as before working through this tutorial I was in the state of learning in that I did not know what I don't know. From working through this tutorial I have discovered what I know that I don't know. I now have a direction to work with in Unity projects.
